# Incompressible-flow-simulation
This repository consists of my final project of the Computational Physics course given at the University of Minho, taught by professor Nuno Castro. 
This Python algorithm is a simulation of a incompressible flow between two paralell plates in two regimes: one at the entry of the system and the other at a region very far from it.
This simulation shows the expected results, predicted by theory and analytical calculations.
